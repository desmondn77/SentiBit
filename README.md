# SentiBit
Market sentiments! This is what many people look for in order to have a safe investment. **SentiBit** is here to help you with that. SentiBit is a Telegram bot that analyzes market sentiments and labels them positive or negative based on the conditions. If there is buying sentiment, it is labeled as positive, and if there is selling sentiment, it is labeled as negative. Another mode is defined as neutral.
All these definitions were related to the first part of SentiBit. SentiBit consists of two parts: **Sentiment** or **Sentiment Analysis** and the word **Bitcoin**.
As you guessed correctly, this telegram bot does the job of analyzing Bitcoin sentiment in the cryptocurrency market. In this notebook, I have attached the steps of making this bot. I hope this information is useful for people and they can use it. It will also be appreciated if you help to apply changes and develop it and push more improved versions.
